# In the simple case, a repository might have a single .gitignore file in its
# root directory, which applies recursively to the entire repository. However,
# it is also possible to have additional .gitignore files in subdirectories.
# The rules in these nested .gitignore files apply only to the files under the
# directory where they are located.
# See man gitignore for the details.

# ignore all .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in any directory named build
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf
