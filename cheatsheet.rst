Cheatsheet

This is my cheatsheet mostly coming from "The entire Pro Git" book, written by
Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and published by Apress, is available at

Get and set repository or global options
----------------------------------------

`git config` lets you get and set configuration variables that control all
aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variable can be stored in three
different places:

  1. `[path]/etc/gitconfig` file: Contains values applied to every user on the
     system and all their repositories. If you pass the option `--system` to
     `git config`, it reads and writes from this file specifically. Because this
     is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser
     privilege to make changes to it.
  2. `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config` file: Values specific personally
     to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically
     by passing the `--global` option, and this affects all of the repositories
     you work with on your system.
  3. `config` file in the Git directory (that is, `.git/config`) of whatever
     repository youâ€™re currently using: Specific to that single repository. You
     can force Git to read from and write to this file with the `--local` option,
     but that is in fact the default. Unsurprisingly, you need to be located
     somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.
