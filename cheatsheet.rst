Cheatsheet
##########

This is my personal cheatsheet mostly coming from "The entire Pro Git" book,
written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, published by Apress, and, available at
`<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_. A print version (PDF format) of the book
is also available locally (see ``progit.pdf``).

What is Git?
============

Snapshots, Not Differences
--------------------------

The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends
included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems
store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems
(CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they
store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time
(this is commonly described as ``delta-based`` version control).

Git doesn't think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data
more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time
you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of
what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that
snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn't store the file
again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git
thinks about its data more like a **stream of snapshots**.

The Three States
----------------

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: ``modified``
``staged``, and ``committed``:

  1. Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it
     to your database yet.
  2. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to
     go into your next commit snapshot.
  3. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project:

  1. The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These
     files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and
     placed on disk for you to use or modify.
  2. The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that
     stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical
     name in Git parlance is the "index", but the phrase "staging area" works
     just as well.
  3. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for
     your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is
     copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

Getting Help
============

If you ever need help while using Git, there are three equivalent ways to get
the comprehensive manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git help <verb>
    $ git <verb> --help
    $ man git-<verb>

For example, you can get the manpage help for the ``git config`` command by
running one of these:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git help config
    $ git config --help
    $ man git-config

In addition, if you don't need the full-blown manpage help, but just need a
quick refresher on the available options for a Git command, you can ask for the
more concise "help" output with the ``-h`` option:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git <verb> -h

Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
==============================================================

``git init`` command creates an empty Git repository - basically a ``.git``
directory with subdirectories for objects, ``refs/heads``, ``refs/tags``, and
``template`` files. An initial ``HEAD`` file that references the ``HEAD`` of the
master branch is also created.

If the ``$GIT_DIR`` environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use
instead of ``./.git`` for the base of the repository.

Running ``git init`` in an existing repository is safe. It will not overwrite
things that are already there.

If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and
you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that
project's directory and type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git init

At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet.

Clone a repository into a new directory
=======================================

``git clone`` clones a repository into a newly created directory,
creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository
(visible using ``git branch --remotes``), and creates and checks out an initial
branch that is forked from the cloned repository's currently active branch.

After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update all the
remote-tracking branches, and a git pull without arguments will in addition
merge the remote master branch into the current master branch, if any.

This default configuration is achieved by creating references to the remote
branch heads under ``refs/remotes/origin`` and by initializing
``remote.origin.url`` and ``remote.origin.fetch`` configuration variables.

You clone a repository with ``git clone <repository> <directory>``. For example,
if you want to clone this Git tutorial, you can do so like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ # Clone into `mygit-tutorial` directory (should not exist or be empty)
    $ git clone git@github.com:gpapia/git-tutorial.git mygit-tutorial
    $ # Clone into `git-tutorial` directory
    $ git clone git@github.com:gpapia/git-tutorial.git

.. code-block:: man

    <repository>
        The (possibly remote) repository to clone from.

    <directory>
        The name of a new directory to clone into. The "humanish" part of the
        source repository is used if no directory is explicitly given (``repo``
        for ``/path/to/repo.git`` and ``foo`` for ``host.xz:foo/.git``). Cloning
        into an existing directory is only allowed if the directory is empty.

Add file contents to the index
==============================

``git add`` command updates the index using the current content found in the
working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It typically
adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it
can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the
working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working
tree anymore.

The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this
snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit. Thus after making any
changes to the working tree, and before running the commit command, you **must**
use the ``add`` command to add any new or modified files to the index.

This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the
content of the specified file(s) at the time the add command is run; if you want
subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you must run ``git add``
again to add the new content to the index.

The ``git add`` command will not add ignored files by default. If any ignored
files were explicitly specified on the command line, git add will fail with a
list of ignored files. Ignored files reached by directory recursion or filename
globbing performed by Git (quote your globs before the shell) will be silently
ignored. The ``git add`` command can be used to add ignored files with the
``-f`` (force) option.

You add files with ``git add <pathspec>``. For example, if you want to add
the ``.gitignore`` file, all files ending with ``.rst``, and all files
inside the ``pictures`` directory, you can do so like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git add .gitignore
    $ git add *.rst
    $ git add pictures/

.. code-bloc:: man

    <pathspec>...
        Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g. ``*.c``) can be given to add
        all matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g. ``dir`` to add
        ``dir/file1`` and ``dir/file2``) can be given to update the index to
        match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g. specifying
        ``dir`` will record not just a file ``dir/file1`` modified in the
        working tree, a file ``dir/file2`` added to the working tree, but also a
        file ``dir/file3`` removed from the working tree).

Git Configuration: Get and set repository or global options
===========================================================

``git config`` lets you get and set configuration variables that control all
aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variable can be stored in three
different places:

  1. ``[path]/etc/gitconfig`` file: Contains values applied to every user on the
     system and all their repositories. If you pass the option ``--system`` to
     ``git config``, it reads and writes from this file specifically. Because
     this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or
     superuser privilege to make changes to it.
  2. ``~/.gitconfig`` or ``~/.config/git/config`` file: Values specific
     personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file
     specifically by passing the ``--global`` option, and this affects all of
     the repositories you work with on your system.
  3. ``config`` file in the Git directory (that is, ``.git/config``) of whatever
     repository youâ€™re currently using: Specific to that single repository. You
     can force Git to read from and write to this file with the ``--local``
     option, but that is in fact the default. Unsurprisingly, you need to be
     located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.

Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in ``.git/config``
trump those in ``[path]/etc/gitconfig``.

Checking your settings and where they are coming from
-----------------------------------------------------

If you want to check your configuration settings, you can use the following
command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git config --list --show-origin

You can also check what Git thinks a specific keyâ€™s value is by typing
``git config <key>``, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git config --show-origin user.name
    file:/home/papiag/.gitconfig    Gianluigi Papia

.. code-block:: man

    -l, --list
        List all variables set in config file, along with their values.

    --show-origin
        Augment the output of all queried config options with the origin type
        (file, standard input, blob, command line) and the actual origin
        (config file path, ref, or blob id if applicable).

Identity Configuration
----------------------

.. code-block:: console

    $ git config --global user.name "Gianluigi Papia"
    $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Editor Configuration
--------------------

.. code-block:: console

    $ git config --global core.editor emacs

Default Branch Name
-------------------

By default Git will create a branch called ``master`` when you create a new
repository with ``git init``. From Git version 2.28 onwards, you can set a
different name for the initial branch.

To set main as the default branch name do:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
