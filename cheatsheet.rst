Cheatsheet
##########

This is my personal cheatsheet mostly coming from "The entire Pro Git" book,
written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, published by Apress, and, available at
`<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_. A print version (PDF format) of the book
is also available locally (see ``progit.pdf``).

What is Git?
============

Snapshots, Not Differences
--------------------------

The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends
included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems
store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems
(CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they
store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time
(this is commonly described as ``delta-based`` version control).

Git doesn't think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data
more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time
you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of
what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that
snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn't store the file
again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git
thinks about its data more like a **stream of snapshots**.

The Three States
----------------

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: ``modified``
``staged``, and ``committed``:

  1. Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it
     to your database yet.
  2. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to
     go into your next commit snapshot.
  3. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project:

  1. The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These
     files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and
     placed on disk for you to use or modify.
  2. The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that
     stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical
     name in Git parlance is the "index", but the phrase "staging area" works
     just as well.
  3. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for
     your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is
     copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

Get and set repository or global options
========================================

``git config`` lets you get and set configuration variables that control all
aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variable can be stored in three
different places:

  1. ``[path]/etc/gitconfig`` file: Contains values applied to every user on the
     system and all their repositories. If you pass the option ``--system`` to
     ``git config``, it reads and writes from this file specifically. Because
     this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or
     superuser privilege to make changes to it.
  2. ``~/.gitconfig`` or ``~/.config/git/config`` file: Values specific
     personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file
     specifically by passing the ``--global`` option, and this affects all of
     the repositories you work with on your system.
  3. ``config`` file in the Git directory (that is, ``.git/config``) of whatever
     repository youâ€™re currently using: Specific to that single repository. You
     can force Git to read from and write to this file with the ``--local``
     option, but that is in fact the default. Unsurprisingly, you need to be
     located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.



Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in ``.git/config``
trump those in ``[path]/etc/gitconfig``.

List settings and where they are coming from
--------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: man

    -l, --list
           List all variables set in config file, along with their values.

    --show-origin
           Augment the output of all queried config options with the origin type (file, standard input, blob, command line) and the actual origin
           (config file path, ref, or blob id if applicable).

.. code-block:: console

    $ git config --list --show-origin
